# Introduction

In this lab we explored different techniques to test software. Exploratory testing is the more 
intuitive and natural technique to do since it’s the first technique you would think of when testing anything. We explored what manual scripted testing reminded us of Unit testing since we are testing specific functions individually. We revisited the defects reported for an updated version of the software to see if all bugs were fixed.  

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We wanted to focus on generic input testing as well as withdrawing and depositing from every type of account available in the system. We wanted to test boundary cases for each interaction such as large sum of money and incorrect input. Testing inputs not shown on the screen as well as consistent behaviour between card 1 and card 2. 

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Manual functional testing is more structured than exploratory. The exploratory testing has a greater capacity of catching bugs that might not appear on a manual test. Manual testing was easier to keep track of defects since the structure allowed for better logging of the testcases failed. 

-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

As soon as report was submitted we had our partner double check our formats for our submitted reports. 

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The lack of format for the exploratory testing was hard to report and keep track of. Although exploratory testing proved to be more effective at finding more bugs, the issues with keeping track of them came up a lot. This problem was remedied by submitting the defect report as soon as we found the defect. We learned that while manual scripted testing takes more time to set up, it streamlines testing process and allows for easier documentation. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

We thought that the submission through Gihub for a formal report is not suitable. Considering the limitations on spellchecking, formatting etc.

# Introduction

In this lab we explored different techniques used to test software. Exploratory testing is the more intuitive and natural technique to use since it is one of the first techniques you would think of when testing a software system. We explored manual scripted testing and it mainly reminded us of unit testing since we are testing specific functionalities individually. We revisited the defects reported for an updated version of the software to see if all bugs were fixed or if any new defects were introduced.   

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

We wanted to focus on generic input testing as well as withdrawing and depositing from every type of account available in the system. We also wanted to test boundary cases for each interaction such as depositing and withdrawing large sums of money or amounts of money that either the machine or account didn't have. Testing inputs not shown on the screen as well as consistent behaviour between card 1 and card 2 were also important in our plan as an inconsistent ATM would lose money in transactions. 

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Manual functional testing is noticibly more structured and refined than exploratory. The exploratory testing seemed to possess a greater capability for catching niche bugs that might not appear on most manual tests. Manual testing also made it easier to keep track of defects since the structure allowed for better logging of the testcases failed. Overall, the manual functional testing helped to streamline the testing progress whereas the exploratory allowed a quick exploration of the shortcomings of the system. 

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

As soon as report was submitted we had our partner recheck the format of our submitted reports. This was to ensure that the reports submitted had enough information to properly deduce what was causing the defect and why it was occurring. We tried to stick the suggested format for bug reports that the lab manual proposed, each one containing the function being tested, the initial state of the program, what steps are necessary to reproduce the bug, and the expected outcome (or oracle) as well as the actual outcome of the test being performed.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The lack of format for the exploratory testing was hard to report and keep track of. Although exploratory testing proved to be more effective at finding more bugs, the issues with keeping track of them came up a lot. This problem was remedied by submitting the defect report as soon as we found the defect. We learned that while manual scripted testing takes more time to set up, it streamlines testing process and allows for easier documentation. 

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

We thought that the submission through Gihub for a formal report is not suitable. Considering the limitations on spellchecking, formatting etc.
